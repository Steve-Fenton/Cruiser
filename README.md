Portraits
---------
Portraits must be placed in the portraits folder, be of format png, and must have a filename the same as your cruise control username. Ie, if your username was 'thomas.moore' the portrait must be called 'thomas.moore.png'.

The default portrait is 75px by 75px. You might want to tweak the size of the portraits, depending on the height of the projects when rendered together.
